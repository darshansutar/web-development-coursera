			Bisi Bele Bhath
		</div>
		<p>
			Bisi Bele Bhath or Bisi Bele Huliyanna is a spicy, rice-based dish with origins in the state of Karnataka, India. Bisi bele bhath, which translates to 'hot lentil rice dish' in Kannada language, is a wholesome meal. The name bisi bēle bhāt is a Kannada phrase, which literally means "hot lentil rice". In Kannada, bisi means hot, bēle means lentil, and bhāt means a dish made of rice.<br>
				<br>
			Bisi bele bhath was invented in the Mysore Palace 300 years ago as a vegetable free piping hot dish. A Kannada writer, K.T. Acharya, has traced the bath to a 10th century dish called Kattaogara. The Kattogara, he says in his book, “A Historical Dictionary of Indian Food,” was rice mixed with ghee, salt and garlic.
